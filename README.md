## Data (3)

Choose a theme that interests you and find and use an open API or other data source for it (e.g., weather data, exchange rates, stock prices, etc.).

Examples of open datasets that you could use:

- Datasets used in Plotly examples and documentation
- Find Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects | Kaggle

## Enrich the data (3)

Add information from another external source (API or dataset) to the data or create new calculated variables.

An example of enrichment could be combining city weather data with population information or adding calculated variables such as averages, trends, or distributions.

## Storage in SQLite Database (6)

Create and use an SQLite database to store the data.

Create appropriate database tables and ensure the database supports the necessary data for visualizations.

## Visualization in Plotly/Dash Application (14)

Create a Dash application (in a separate file) that retrieves data from the SQLite database and presents it interactively to the user.

Include at least one graphical representation (e.g., line, bar, or map chart) that the user can explore.

Provide the user with options to filter, sort, or modify the visualized data.# tpl-python-final-assignment
